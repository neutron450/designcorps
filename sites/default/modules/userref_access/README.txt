userref_access

This module works with CCK userreference fields and the
node_access module to add additional grants to nodes.

To enable userref_access on a node, edit the userreference
field for the node type and check the "Use User Reference
Access" box.

Any users that are referenced by this field will be given
view permissions for the node, all other useres will be
denided access to the node.
